            <p>
              What Is Sensitive Personal Information? “Sensitive Personal
              Information” is information about an individual that reveals their
              racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or
              philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic
              information, biometric information for the purpose of uniquely
              identifying an individual, information concerning health, or
              information concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual
              orientation. We do not knowingly or intentionally collect
              sensitive Personal Information from individuals, and you must not
              submit sensitive Personal Information to us. If, however, you
              inadvertently or unintentionally transmit sensitive Personal
              Information to us, you will be considered to have explicitly
              consented to us processing that sensitive Personal Information.
